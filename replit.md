# Salon Booking System

## Overview
This Django-based salon booking system provides comprehensive functionality for salon management, appointment scheduling, user accounts, and subscriptions. It supports Portuguese localization and features a modern, responsive frontend with PWA capabilities. The system aims to streamline salon operations, enhance customer experience, and provide robust management tools, including a cancellation policy system with configurable fees and a product store.

## User Preferences
I prefer a clear and concise explanation style. When making changes, prioritize core functionality and maintain the existing architectural patterns. Please ask for confirmation before implementing significant structural changes or introducing new third-party libraries. Focus on delivering production-ready code with good performance and security.

## System Architecture
The project is built on Django and uses a modular application structure with dedicated apps for `accounts`, `appointments`, `core`, `salons`, and `subscriptions`.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Frontend Frameworks:** Bootstrap 5.3.8, HTMX 2.0.7, and Chart.js 4.4.0 for an interactive user experience.
- **Design System:** Modern CSS design tokens, comprehensive dark/light mode support, and smooth transitions.
- **PWA Features:** Full Progressive Web App functionality including service worker, offline pages, app installation, and optimized icons.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive design optimized for all device sizes.
- **Accessibility:** Full ARIA compliance, screen reader support, and keyboard navigation.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Robust system with conflict prevention, timezone awareness, and protections against race conditions using atomic transactions. Includes salon status controls.
- **Cancellation Policy:** Salons can configure cancellation policies with optional enablement, customizable penalty percentages (0-100%), and a configurable time limit before the appointment for penalty application. Tracks `CancellationFee` with payment status.
- **Product Store:** Comprehensive `Product` model with categories, prices, affiliate links, and images. Features an administrative panel for product management and a merchant dashboard section for product suggestions.
- **User Authentication:** Email and password-based login for salon owners. Registration process automatically creates a salon and assigns a trial subscription.
- **Localization:** System is localized for Portuguese (pt-br) and uses the America/Sao_Paulo timezone.
- **Deployment:** Configured for autoscale production deployment using Gunicorn.
- **Payment Integration:** Mercado Pago integration for processing payments, including webhooks for subscription activation and renewal.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Database:** SQLite for development. PostgreSQL with exclusion constraints is recommended for production.
- **Media Files:** Configured for file uploads with Pillow support. Salon and user profile photos are stored as URLFields.
- **Security:** All views are protected by authentication and access control. Service worker configured with secure caching strategies.
- **Performance:** Optimized with preconnect, lazy loading, and Core Web Vitals monitoring.
